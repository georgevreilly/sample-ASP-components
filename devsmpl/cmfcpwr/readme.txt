Overview
========

This is the MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) version of the Power
sample object for Active Server Pages.  It demonstrates how to write
a component that makes use of the intrinsic ASP objects.

Please read the top-level ReadMe for all the Simple and Power samples.

Look at CMFCPwr.idl, Power.h, and Power.cpp to see how these methods
and properties are declared and implemented.
