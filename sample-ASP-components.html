<h1>Cookie Munger</h1>

<p>2002/09/14. I have added the Cookie Munger sample ISAPI filter as a
separate file, <a href="./CkyMunge.zip">CkyMunge.zip</a>. It is no longer
included in recent copies of the Platform SDK.</p>


<h1>Sample ASP Components</h1>

<p>In the Spring of 1997, I wrote an article on <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/server/asp/comp.asp">
Developing Active Server Components with ATL</a>. At the end, I
make reference to several sample components that supposedly live
at the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.asp">
Windows Download Site</a>. Most of those components were pulled
from the site many months ago, because they were marked as Beta
components. Actually, no problems had been reported with them in
a very long time, that I know of. I've been trying, without
success, to get them reposted, since I get occasional requests
for them. I've gotten sick of the delays in the bureaucracy, so
I'm posting them here on my personal website.

<p>Microsoft doesn't support any of these components, and neither
do I. If you do find problems with the components, feel free to
tell me about them; however, I don't guarantee to do anything
about those problems.

<p>Download the source for the <a href="sample-ASP-components.zip">
sample components</a>.

<p>The components:
<ul>
  <li>	Ad Rotator.
  <li>	ASP to HTML Converter.
  <li>	Browser Capabilities.
  <li>	Content Rotator.
  <li>	Simple Developer Samples in ATL, MFC, Java, VB4, and VB5.
  <li>	HTML Table.
  <li>	Next Link.
  <li>	Page Counter.
  <li>	Permission Checker.
  <li>	Registry.
  <li>	Summary Info.
  <li>	Text Formatter.
  <li>	Tracer.
  <li>	Weather.
</ul>

<p>Someday soon I will update the article to deal with IIS 4.0
and beyond. In the meantime, you could do worse than read
