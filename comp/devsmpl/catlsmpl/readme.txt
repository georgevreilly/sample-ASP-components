Overview
========

This is the ATL (ActiveX Template Library) version of the Simple
sample object for Active Server Pages.  It demonstrates how to write
a component that has straightforward methods and properties.

Please read the top-level ReadMe for all the Simple and Power samples.

Look at CATLSmpl.idl, Simple.h, and Simple.cpp to see how these
methods and properties are declared and implemented.
