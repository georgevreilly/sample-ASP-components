The test environment consists of two parts
1) The AspEnv.dll which supplies the IObjectContext and server instrinsics
2) The TestApp.exe which will stress components.

The two pieces are totally independent (you don't need to use one to use the other)

AspEnv.dll
In order to use aspenv.dll you must do 2 things
1) you must put AspEnv.dll somewhere in your path (so it can be loaded) and put the aspenv.ini file in the same directory.
2) Link you component with aspenv.lib instead of mtx.lib (keep mtxguid.lib).

Now when you call GetObjectContext, you will get back a fake object context that can return simulated server intrinics (via the usally methods).  The behavior of the server intrinsics is determine by the AspEnv.ini file.  For example, IServer::MapPath will return a path based on MapPathBase in the [Server] section.

TestApp.exe
The test app also works using ini files.  This time, one for each component you want to test.  The ini files should be kept in the comp/ directory beneath the testapp.exe.  Each ini file describes how to test the component and what methods to test.  An example follows:

[class]
ProgID="foo.bar"
scope=application ; or session or page

[method1]
type=Get ; or put or method
BSTR="hello"	; first parameter
int=78		; second parameter

The scope determines how the object is tested:
page:	an instance is created, all methods are called, and the instance is destroyed
session: one instance per thread, it exists until all iterations have been run, then destroyed
application: one instance for all threads.
