Overview
========

The Text Format Component is an Active Server Pages component that
can be used to format text files for use in <TEXTAREA> controls
on older browsers which do not wrap <TEXTAREA> controls for you.


Installation
============

In order to use this component you must register it.  This will allow Active
Server Pages (ASP) Scripting Languages and other languages to make use of
the component.  ASP uses either the Server.CreateObject("ObjectName") syntax
or the <object id="myName" progid="ObjectName" runat="server"> syntax to
gain access to an object.  New objects can be made ready for use by
installing a new component.  Note: One component may contain more than one
object definition.

The following directions are to help you register the component for use:
 1. Use the Start menu, Programs option to start a Command Prompt
 2. Type the following:
	cd \InetPub\ASPSamp\Components\TextFmt\DLL\C\i386
 3. Type:
	regsvr32 TextFmt.dll
Note: you must register the component on each IIS server where you intend
to use it.

If you have trouble registering components, you may be using the wrong
version of RegSvr32.exe.  Please use the version installed by default in
the directory <InstallDir>\ASP\Cmpnts.  On Windows NT, the default
installation directory is \winnt\System32\Inetsrv.  On Windows 95, it is
\Program Files\WebSvr\System.

(If you rebuild the source code, the makefile will automatically reregister
the component for you.)

The following directions are to help you test the registered component:
 1. Use the Windows Explorer to copy all of the Sample files from
    \InetPub\ASPSamp\Components\TextFmt\Samples to \InetPub\ASPSamp\Samples.
 2. In your browser, open http://localhost/ASPSamp/Samples/TextFmt.asp
You must copy the sample file to a virtual directory; if you attempt to
examine it with a browser in the TextFmt\Samples directory, ASP will not
execute the script.


Usage
======

To use the Text Format component, simply call Server.CreateObject and
then call the method WrapTextFromFile to invoke the formatter.

Sample ASP
==========

See the Samples directory.  You must copy the samples to a virtual
directory (it need not be a virtual root) on an IIS Server before they
will work.


Build Notes
===========

This sample requires Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 or newer and ATL version
2.1 installed with it.

If you get an error about "don't know how to make asptlb.h", you will
need to copy <InstallDir>\ASP\Cmpnts\AspTlb.h to your include
directory.

Finally you must have the lastest version of MS Transaction Server
installed (part of IIS 4.0).  Add the include path and library path
of MTX before any system directories under Tools:Options....  So your
include path might look like this: c:\program files\mts\include;
c:program files\devstudio\vc\include;... (depending on where you have
installed MTX).  If you intend to build from the command line, you
must edit vcvars32.bat accordingly as well.

You can build this component with nmake at the command line.  Read
Makefile for more details.  You can also build it in Microsoft
Developer Studio, using the TextFmt.dsp project.

The component can be built as ANSI or Unicode.

Before you can use the text format component, you must register its DLL
with regsvr32.  The makefiles take care of this automatically for you.


Support
=======

This component is not officially supported by Microsoft Corporation.
Peer support is available on the Active Server Pages mailing list or on
the microsoft.public.inetserver.iis.activeserverpages newsgroup.
