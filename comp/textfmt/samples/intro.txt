     Text Formatter Server Component

The motivation for the
text
formatter
   component
is to display text reasonably on browsers
which
do not
wrap
text by
default.
(such as Netscape.)
Normally, on these browsers, long run-on fields are scrolled to the right.  This is likely to happen in the case with input text from databases.
With the database scenario, it is also
likely that the text will be formatted
for a different column width than the
width of the <TEXTAREA> element.

The formatter has two properties:

* Function About() As String

--> returns a description of the component


* Function WrapTextFromFile(strFile as String, cchWidth As Integer)

--> Reads the contents of the text file "strFile" and formats the text
    to fit in "cchWidth" columns.  The resultant text is output using the
    "Response.Write" method.   Characters that can cause grief (such as
    '>' and '<') are automatically encoded into their HTML escape codes
    ('&lt;' and '&gt;') so as to make it legal for the text to contain the
    literal string "</TEXTAREA>" with impunity.

+   If "strFile" does not exist, the component will throw an exception.

+   Single newlines between lines of text are discarded.  Multiple line
    breaks are preserved, as a sequence of newlines is assumed to begin a
    new paragraph.
