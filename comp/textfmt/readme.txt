Overview
========

The Text Formatter component is an Active Server Pages component that
can be used to format text files for use in <TEXTAREA> controls on
older browsers which do not wrap <TEXTAREA> controls for you.

The component has three parallel implementations: C++, Java, and Visual
Basic 5.  Please read Source\C\ReadMe.txt, Source\Java\ReadMe.txt, and
Source\VB\ReadMe.txt for further details.
